# Flex Program Collection

This folder contains a collection of basic Flex (Lex) programs demonstrating different pattern recognition and simple computational tasks. Each file corresponds to a specific task as described below.

## Task List

1. **Identify Small and Capital Letters**  
   Write a Flex program to identify lowercase and uppercase letters from a given string.

2. **Count Numbers and Words in a String**  
   Write a Flex program that counts the number of numeric values and words from an input string.

3. **Identify Small and Capital Letters from a String**  
   Write a Flex program to distinguish and identify small and capital letters in a string.

4. **Start with 'p' and End with 'q'**  
   Write a Flex program to identify strings that start with the letter `'p'` and end with `'q'`.

5. **String that Starts and Ends with `end` and Has at Least One Alphabet**  
   Write a Flex program to identify strings which start with the word `end`, contain at least one alphabet (uppercase or lowercase), and also end with `end`.

6. **String that Starts and Ends with `end` and Has 2 to 4 Characters in Between**  
   Write a Flex program to identify strings that start with `end`, have between 2 and 4 characters in between, and end with `end`.

7. **Identify Integer or Floating Point Numbers**  
   Write a Flex program to detect and recognize integer and floating point numbers from the input.

8. **Simple Calculator (Addition and Subtraction)**  
   Write a basic calculator using Flex that performs addition and subtraction operations.

9. **Accept Strings Containing `pq` or `PQ`**  
   Write a Flex program that accepts any string which contains the substring `pq` or `PQ` anywhere in it.
